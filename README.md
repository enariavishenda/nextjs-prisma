###### `Hello there! (c) Kenobi`

It's my build on npm! I want to build a Fullstack App with Next.js, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL!



First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

See later!
I just working on this!
